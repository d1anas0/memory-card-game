Features I have added: 
- created my own svg files to make this game uniquely mine
- a reset game button
- countdown timer 

I've several more ideas to add to this, but feel free to suggest them to me as a challenge! 

Thanks for being here - hope you enjoy playing the game! Let me know how you went
